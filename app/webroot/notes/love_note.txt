SWEET MANDI,

YOU TALK TO ME IN ALL THE LANGUAGES THAT MATTER.

YOU SPEAK TO MY HEART. MY HEART WAS A MESS BEFORE YOU. I HAD HEALED IT BEST I COULD. THE PAST PAINS OF WRONGS IN MY LIFE I'VE ENDURED HAS TAUGHT ME WELL. THAT'S WHAT I WOULD TELL MYSELF, YOU'VE HELPED MADE ME FEEL WORTHY OF BEING LOVED AGAIN. I WAS IN A VERY DARK PLACE, I HAD FOUND INNER STRENGTH I DIDN'T KNOW EXIST PULL ME OUT OF IT, BUT NOTHING COULD HAVE PREPARED ME FOR HOW A HEART SHOULD ACTUALLY FEEL. YOU'VE LOVED ME SO COMPLETELY IT'S BREATH TAKING. MY HEART FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY ADULT LIFE FEELS SAFE.

YOU SPEAK TO MY SOUL. YOU SAID IT BEST WHEN YOU SAID YOUR SOUL RECOGNIAES MINE. WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER A RELATIVLY SHORT TIME, BUT I FEEL LIKE I'VE KNOWN YOU MY ENTIRE LIFE. PERHAPS WE WERE TOGETHER IN A PAST LIFE. I JUST FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH YOU. I JUST KNOW I CAN TRUST YOU, I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY, I DON'T HAVE TO STORM. I WAS MEANT FOR YOU, I FEEL IT. IT'S UNEXPLAINABLE, I CAN'T DESCRIBE HOW I KNOW, I'M A REASONABLE PERSON AND I'M NOT SURE I HAVE THE ABILITY TO REASONABLY EXPLAIN TO ANYONE BUT YOU HOW I KNOW, BUT I KNOW. THIS MUST BE WHAT PEOPLE WITH FAITH FEEL, IT'S COMFORTING. I HAVE FAITH IN YOU, IN US.

YOU SPEAK TO MY BODY. I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO EXPRESS MY SEXUALITY LIKE I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WITH YOU. I'VE HAD KINKS AND FANTASIES, BUT NO ONE HAS EVER COME CLOSE TO YOU. YOU MAKE ALL MY DREAMS COME TRUE. IT'S BEEN AMAAING BEING ABLE TO OPEN MYSELF UP TO YOU, MY DESIRES, MY ENJOYMENTS, MY FANTASIES. YOU HAVE NOT ONLY ACCEPTED MY KINKS, BUT ENJOYED THEM WITH ME. I'VE NEVER FELT SO CONNECTED TO ANYONE! I LOVE HOW YOU MAKE ME FEEL IN THE BEDROOM. I LOVE BEING OWNED, THEN TAKING YOU BACK. I LOVE TASTING YOU, ENJOYING YOUR BODY WITH MY HANDS, MOUTH, AND COCK. YOU ARE THE SEXIEST THING I HAVE EVER LAID EYES ON AND I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF YOU! I ACHE FOR YOUR TOUCH. I LONG FOR YOUR KISSES. I REACH FOR YOU ANYTIME I PASS CLOSE TO YOU. MY BODY CRAVES YOUR BODY!

YOU SPEAK TO MY MIND. YOU'RE THE SMARTEST MOST ADMIRABLE WOMAN I KNOW. YOUR OPTIMISM IS INSPIRING. I LOVE HOW YOU SEE THE WORLD. YOU TRULY CARE ABOUT YOUR FELLOW MAN'S WELL BEING. YOU DON'T BELIEVE ANYONE IS TRULY EVIL, THAT CHOICES ARE ALWAYS COMING AND ANYONE CAN, AT ANYTIME, CHOOSE A BETTER PATH. YOU SEE THE GOOD IN EVERYONE, AND I ABSOLUTELY ADORE THAT ABOUT YOU. YOU'RE INCREDIBLY FUN, AND FUNNY. I'VE NEVER LAUGHED SO MUCH IN ALL MY LIFE SPENDING TIME WITH YOU. WE WATCH SHOWS LIKE ARROW, AND I TRULY ENJOY WATCHING ARROW, I EVEN LIKE THE SHOW, BUT IT'S SO MUCH FUN TO BE ABLE TO JUST MAKE FUN OF IT AS WE GO ALONG. YOU'LL FOLLOW MY EVERY STRANGE RIDICULOUS TANGENT, AND PAUSE JUST TO SHOOT ME AN "I LOVE YOU" FACE (OH THAT FACE, IT THAT MAKES ME MELT). THE CODES YOU COME UP WITH FOR ME ARE CHALLENGING AND INCREDIBLY FUN. I LOVE THAT YOU HAVE FAITH IN ME I WILL CRACK IT. I LOVE YOUR MIND, YOUR INTELLIGENCE IS A HUGE TURN ON!!!

I CAN SEE YOU'VE BEEN HURT BEFORE. I CAN RELATE TO YOUR PAIN AND YOUR FEARS. I WANT YOU TO KNOW, AND I WILL NEVER STOP REMINDING YOU, HOW MUCH YOU MEAN TO ME; HOW MADLY IN LOVE WITH YOU I AM. NO ONE HOLDS A CANDLE TO YOU MY LOVE. I WILL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR YOU, IN YOUR CORNER, BY YOUR SIDE. WE ARE WORTH FIGHTING FOR.

I'VE NEVER FELT SO COMPLETELY LOVED BEFORE. I'VE NEVER KNOWN SOMEONE SO AMAZING. I'VE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER IN MY LIFE. I SIT HERE NURSING A FEVER AND ALL I CAN THINK OF IS YOU, BREAKING YOUR NEWEST CODE AND WRITING YOU BACK HOW MUCH I TRULY LOVE AND ADORE YOU. THAT I MISS YOU WHEN YOU'RE NOT AROUND. YOUR EFFORTS ARE NOTICED, APPRECIATED, AND LOVED. I LOVE YOU!!

YOURS, ALWAYS,
NICK
